Hi Jobby,



Quick update before you proceed further — I realized I need to correct the timeline and clarify scope so we’re aligned (and so your effort stays properly paid and scoped).



First: thank you again for the proactive progress you made already. The fixes you identified are exactly the type of clean, detail-oriented work I’m looking for.



Timeline correction


In my job post I wrote “before Jan 12th,” but that’s no longer accurate. You actually have until Sunday, January 18 to deliver, which gives us a full week.



Because the deadline pressure is lower now, the original $500 “urgent” price point doesn’t really apply for just V0-CORE.



Scope clarification (important)


Originally, in my head, the $500 bundle included an additional module that isn’t clearly stated in the post/docs:



Flashcards module (buggy today; needs to be shipped clean)
A working spaced repetition system

Speech recognition for practice (and storing results)

Audio generation for each card, stored in DB per card

Ability to import flashcards via TSV copy/paste (create cards + save to DB)

Overall stability pass (it exists but is currently buggy)



So here are two clean options, and you can pick whichever you prefer:



Option A — V0-CORE only (recommended if we want fastest/cleanest ship)


$350 fixed, due Sunday, Jan 18

Includes:

Section 4 bug fully resolved (syntax + conversation edge function calls succeed; status updates to completed/error correctly)

Habits persistence (tables + CRUD + daily completion cells persisted)

Goals persistence (tables + CRUD persisted)

Manual QA checklist + screenshots + PR ready to merge



Option B — V0-CORE + Flashcards module shipped clean


$450 fixed, due Sunday, Jan 18

Includes everything in Option A, plus the Flashcards module items above (SRS + speech recognition + audio generation/storage + TSV import + bugfix pass).



Access / next steps


To finish end-to-end, we’ll still need:

A testing OpenAI API key (I’ll provide one)

The migration run on my Supabase project

Final verification + QA evidence (screenshots)

PR(s) with clear commits + short handover notes



If you reply with “Option A” or “Option B”, I’ll confirm immediately and send the access details you need so you can wrap everything cleanly.



Best,

Tom
